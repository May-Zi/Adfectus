# 112-Term-Project
15-112 final Term Project (freshman year, fall 2021)


## Description:
The project is named Adfectus, which directly translates to “affected” in Latin. The basic premise of the project is to infer a user’s emotion, then act upon it by offering some sort of user experience correlating to that emotion and the user’s preferences. For example, playing the user’s favorite song if they’re happy, or creating a new diary entry for them when they’re sad.
 
## Setup:
Only the file named “Adfectus.py” will need to run in an editor. It will create all the files and directory that it initially needs automatically when ran for the first time.
The deep learning model (the file named “reduced_datasets_model.h5”) and an image (“themes_icon.png”) will need to be in the same directory as the main file (“Adfectus.py”).
